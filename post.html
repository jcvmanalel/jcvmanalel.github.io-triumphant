                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>Stop running! Don’t you know who you are?  You are a child of the Most High God. You are more than a conqueror! You were born to win! Instead of throwing in the towel every time you are challenged, it is time to step up to the plate and defeat what has been defeating you.</p>

                    <p>As believers, I believe we often forget that the power of God has been made available to us in our daily lives.  Much like Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, we try to avoid dealing with challenges that come our way.  When we are not avoiding them, we try to play God in our own lives and do it all in our own strength.</p>

                    <p><b>Our salvation is not based on our works, but on our believing!</b>  It is all through faith.  Remember upon the finished work of the cross, the Grace and Power of God was made available to you and me as we accepted the sacrifice of Jesus.  <b> IT IS FINISHED!</b>  When He uttered those 3 words on the cross it gave us access to that Grace and Power. What good news!</p>

                    <p>Again, we find Paul asking God each time to take away his weaknesses, his frailties, his mess-ups, only for God to respond; <i>“My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.”</i> This would have angered many of us. We want to be free instantly.</p>

                    <p>Take a look at <b>Titus 2:11-12</b> (AMP) “For the grace of God (His unmerited favor and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind. 12 It has trained us to reject and renounce all ungodliness and worldly (passionate) desires, to live discreet (temperate, self-controlled), upright, devout (spiritually whole) lives in this present world.”  His Grace is Power!  It instructs us, equips us and empowers us</p>

                    <p>It is by the grace of God that we are destined to conquer, destined to win. It is not by our own might, nor by our own power, but by the Spirit of Almighty God.  Take a lesson from Paul today and be a winner! From this point on, learn to boast in your weaknesses and allow His Grace and Power to be manifested in your life.</p>

                    <blockquote>Father, forgive us for running from our challenges. I pray that we will begin to face every obstacle head on knowing and trusting that you have already equipped us with the Grace and Power needed to overcome every obstacle in Jesus Mighty Name Amen.</blockquote>

                    <p>Are you ready to embrace those fears and allow the power of God to be made known in your life? Do you realize the need to deal with your fears before moving forward?</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
